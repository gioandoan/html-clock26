# Project Principles: Code Quality, Testing Standards, and Performance Requirements

## Code Quality Principles
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code with clear naming conventions.
- Follow consistent formatting and style guidelines throughout the codebase.
- Avoid code duplication; use modular and reusable components.
- Document complex logic and public interfaces with concise comments.

## Testing Standards
- Implement automated tests for all critical functionality.
- Use unit, integration, and end-to-end tests where appropriate.
- Ensure tests are reliable, repeatable, and easy to run.
- Maintain high test coverage and update tests alongside code changes.

## Performance Requirements
- Optimize code for efficient execution and minimal resource usage.
- Profile and monitor performance regularly, addressing bottlenecks.
- Set and enforce performance benchmarks for key features.
- Avoid unnecessary computations and memory allocations.
